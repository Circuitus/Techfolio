            <p style="color: #191919">Let's start with the compass on the homepage</p>

            <p style="color: #191919"> 'Compass' has kind of become my tag for everything. For stuff I do in school, like kahoot and quizlet, and stuff I do outside of school, like as my tag in discord. One could say it has almost become an alternate persona for me, and if I can't use the English word compass, I will either go to one of the non-generic English ways of saying compass, like 'northseeker', or use the word compass in a foreign language, like how 'boussole' means compass in French.</p>

            <p style="color: #191919"> So, when I use the compass on the homepage, it means that this website represents me. That I have made it mine and that I have personalised it. That this website is my, original, work.</p>

            <p style="color: #191919">But what about colour choice?</p>

            <p style="color: #191919">This too was very intentional.</p>

            <p style="color: #191919">I had four different colour schemes that I created using coolors.co, but I eventually went for the one that you see here.</p>

            <p style="color: #191919">The first colour scheme that we will look at is the one that has been selected for the website.</p>
